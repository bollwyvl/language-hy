# [Hy](http://hylang.org/) language support in Atom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bollwyvl/language-hy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bollwyvl/language-hy)

Adds syntax highlighting to Hy files in Atom.

This is a quick and dirty fork of [language-python](https://github.com/atom/language-python), with a bit of scraped Hy builtins.

It is mainly to demonstrate use of the [Hy kernel](https://github.com/bollwyvl/hy_kernel) for [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) with
[Hydrogen](https://atom.io/packages/hydrogen).

Likely, the entire grammar needs to be overhauled, perhaps inspired by an existing lisp like [clojure](https://github.com/atom/language-clojure/blob/master/grammars/clojure.cson).

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [Python TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/python.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
